## Installation
The least intrusive way to install and use vim2tor is to simply not install it at all. The raw text file that is the basic of the application is available in plain text form inside of this repository: [/src/vim2tor.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makccr/vim2tor/refs/heads/main/src/vim2tor.txt) 

Keep in mind however that the best practice, if proceeding with the above method is to generate a new copy of the text file with each launch, in order to preserve the lessons and formatting. As such it is the developer's recommendation to download the master bash script that is used for this purpose in the application. The script can be found at: [/src/vim2tor.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makccr/vim2tor/refs/heads/main/src/vim2tor.sh) And can be made executable with the command: 

```
chmod +x vim2tor.sh
```
